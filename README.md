# Aliasify

Creates a Fish alias for the argument provided.
Requires use of [Terminal Aliases](https://bitbucket.org/displayflex/terminal_aliases/src/master/README.md) Package, although could be easily modified to work with a custom alias file.

## TODO

* Figure out why periods don't seem to be being passed through as when part of arguments, needs quoted/escaped?
* Get $HOME replacement working via variables, rather than hardcorded.
